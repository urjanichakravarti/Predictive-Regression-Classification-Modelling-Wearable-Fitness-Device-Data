# Wearable-Device-Modelling

## Objective
This project utilizes data from widely used fitness devices such as Apple Watch and 
FitBit. The primary objectives include developing a predictive model for estimating an 
individual's calorie expenditure and constructing a classification model to classify individuals 
into various activity levels like Lying, Running, Self-Paced walking, Sitting, etc. The 
regression models faced challenges because of the dataset's nonlinear and intricate nature. 
Among the classification models, the random forest algorithm exhibited superior performance 
with an accuracy rate of 98%. 

## Getting Started
